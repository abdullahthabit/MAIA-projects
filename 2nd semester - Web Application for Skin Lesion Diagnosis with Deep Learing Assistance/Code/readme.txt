1. First go to the directory of the project in cmd: "npm install"
2. After installing everything: "nodemon server.js" or "node server.js"
3. The server will start
4. I have created two pages: index.ejs and about.ejs(they are inside "views/pages"
5. If you want to add new page, copy one of these files and then save them inside
the same folder
6. Go to "server.js" and create a new route like "/about"
7. Go to to "views/partials/nav.ejs" and new menu for the new page if you want
8. Mainly read how ejs works and look for tutorails
