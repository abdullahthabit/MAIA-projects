We appologize for not having the time to develop a GUI for the program
as we have encountered serious issues with our previous method, causing us to 
switch the method after weeks of working, which has left us with very limited time. 

However, the code is very organized and easy to use:

## you only need to run the file: MainCode

## make sure you add the project folder and subfolder to your MATLAB path

## navigate to the folder of the patient Nifti data, or add the training data
	folder to MATLAB path

## on MainCode file: change the 3rd line according to the patient you want to test
	for example -- ImageName = 'patient0XX_4d.nii.gz';
	--- change the XX to patient number (i.e 01 for the 1st patient)

## Then click run, locate the marker inside the LV cavity

## Wait, and finally, the segmentation results for the slices of the respective patient
	will show up
